- **New robustness dataset**: **Degraded-Cityscapes+ (D-Cityscapes+)** (Novel model for snow and unfavourable light)
- **Unifying degradation pipeline**: unifying pipeline to assess the robustness of panoptic segmentation models for assisted and automated driving (AAD) systems, correlating it with image quality.
- **Benchmarking experiments**: 14 state-of-the-art CNN- and transformer-based panoptic segmentation networks are used to compare their robustness.
